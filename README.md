> In this document the MiR250 roboter is referred as MiR

## Using the web-interface

The MiR can be maintained and controlled by a web-interface. Access ist gained by connecting to the network the MiR is
connected to. These networks can be of two different types: The network **hosted** by the MiR itself or a network the
MiR is **connected** to.

### MiR-hosted network
Out of the box the MiR will host its own wifi-network. It will be present, even if the MiR is connected to multiple
other networks at the same time. Therefore, it can be used as a backup network, in case other networks fail.

### Additional networks 

## Using the REST API
