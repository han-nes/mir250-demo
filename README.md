> **In this document the MiR250 roboter is referred as MiR**

## Using the web-interface

The MiR can be maintained and controlled by a web-interface. Access ist gained by connecting to the network the MiR is
connected to. These networks can be of two different types: The network **hosted** by the MiR itself or a network the
MiR is **connected** to.

### MiR-hosted network
Out of the box the MiR will host its own wifi-network. It will be present, even if the MiR is connected to multiple
other networks at the same time. Therefore, it can be used as a backup network, in case other networks fail.

The web-interface can then be accessed via http://mir.com

### Additional networks 
In order to add an additional network, connect to the MiR-hosted network and open the web-interface. Open the system tab and jump into Settings -> Wifi. Use 'Add connection' to add an additional network.

The web-interface will than be accessed via the IP-address the MiR will be given

> ðŸš¨ If connected to the MiR through an additional network, the connection is sometimes aborted randomly

### Authorization
The web-interface will ask for authorization when it will be opened the first time. Once logged in, the credentials are saved via cookies.

Stock username and password are:

**Username**: Distributor -  **Password**: distributor

## Using the REST API

> The REST API is working parallel to the web-interface. In every situation the web-interface is used, the REST API will also work.

### Getting Started with Python

Look at some code-examples in [./rest_api](./rest_api). There is a unfinished library in [./rest_api/test.py](./rest_api/test.py)  to easy-controll the API. Code-snippets are also there.

## Using the rosbridge

Rosbridge-Documentation: http://wiki.ros.org/rosbridge_suite
Python-Client: https://github.com/gramaziokohler/roslibpy

The *rosbridge* is a service hosted on the MiR that enables interaction with the ROS-system via network (a websocket). Thr MiR hosts a **server** and any network-device can connect as a **client**. There are java, javascript and python libraries that help with the client-server communication. For communication the JSON-standart is used.

### Getting Started with rosbridge
For now, just look at some code-examples in [./rosbridge](./RESTAPI).
